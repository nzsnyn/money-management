# Email Verification System

This document outlines the email verification system implemented in the Money Management application.

## Overview

The application now includes a complete email verification system that:
- Requires users to verify their email addresses after registration
- Prevents unverified users from accessing the dashboard
- Provides email resend functionality
- Sends welcome emails after successful verification

## Features Implemented

### 1. Email Service (`lib/email.ts`)
- **Email transporter setup** using nodemailer with SMTP configuration
- **Verification token generation** using crypto.randomBytes
- **Email templates** with HTML and text versions
- **Error handling** for email sending failures

### 2. API Routes

#### Registration (`/api/auth/register`)
- Creates users with verification tokens
- Sends verification emails automatically
- Returns appropriate response indicating verification requirement

#### Email Verification (`/api/auth/verify-email`)
- Validates verification tokens
- Updates user verification status
- Sends welcome emails after successful verification
- Handles expired or invalid tokens

#### Resend Verification (`/api/auth/resend-verification`)
- Generates new verification tokens
- Resends verification emails
- Validates user existence and verification status

#### User Details (`/api/user/[id]`)
- Secure endpoint for fetching user verification status
- Session-based authorization
- Returns user details excluding sensitive information

### 3. UI Components

#### Email Verification Page (`/auth/verify-email`)
- Handles verification token processing
- Shows success/error states with appropriate messaging
- Auto-redirects to sign-in after successful verification

#### Resend Verification Component
- Allows users to request new verification emails
- Rate limiting through UI state management
- Success/error feedback

#### Email Verification Required Component
- Blocks unverified users from dashboard access
- Provides easy access to resend functionality
- Option to sign out and use different account

### 4. Authentication Updates

#### NextAuth Configuration
- Modified to check email verification status during sign-in
- Prevents unverified users from creating sessions
- Provides clear error messages for verification requirements

#### Dashboard Protection
- Fetches user verification status on load
- Redirects unverified users to verification requirement page
- Maintains secure access control

## Configuration

### Environment Variables Required

```env
# Email Configuration
EMAIL_SERVER_HOST="smtp.gmail.com"
EMAIL_SERVER_PORT="587"
EMAIL_SERVER_USER="your-email@gmail.com"
EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD="your-app-password"
EMAIL_FROM="your-email@gmail.com"
```

### Gmail Setup (for development)
1. Enable 2-factor authentication on your Gmail account
2. Generate an app-specific password
3. Use your Gmail address and app password in the environment variables

### Database Schema Updates
- Added `isEmailVerified`, `emailVerificationToken`, and `emailVerificationExpires` fields to User model
- Updated Prisma schema and pushed changes to database

## User Flow

1. **Registration**
   - User fills out registration form
   - Account is created with `isEmailVerified: false`
   - Verification email is sent automatically
   - User sees success message indicating email verification requirement

2. **Email Verification**
   - User clicks verification link in email
   - Token is validated and user is marked as verified
   - Welcome email is sent
   - User is redirected to sign-in page

3. **Sign-in Process**
   - User attempts to sign in
   - System checks email verification status
   - Unverified users see error message and resend option
   - Verified users proceed normally

4. **Dashboard Access**
   - System double-checks verification status
   - Unverified users see verification requirement page
   - Verified users access full dashboard functionality

## Security Features

- **Token Expiration**: Verification tokens expire after 24 hours
- **Secure Token Generation**: Uses cryptographically secure random bytes
- **Session Protection**: Dashboard checks verification status on every load
- **User Isolation**: Users can only access their own verification status

## Error Handling

- **Email Sending Failures**: Registration continues even if email fails to send
- **Invalid Tokens**: Clear error messages for expired or invalid verification links
- **Network Issues**: Graceful handling of email service outages
- **Database Errors**: Proper error responses for data layer issues

## Testing Considerations

For development testing:
1. Set up a test email account (Gmail recommended)
2. Configure environment variables with test credentials
3. Test the complete flow: register → verify → sign in
4. Verify that unverified users cannot access protected routes

## Future Enhancements

1. **Email Templates**: More sophisticated HTML email templates
2. **Rate Limiting**: Server-side rate limiting for verification emails
3. **Email Providers**: Support for multiple email service providers
4. **Admin Panel**: Admin interface to manage user verification status
5. **Batch Operations**: Bulk email verification management
